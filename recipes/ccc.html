        <h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>
            <p>A recipe that will passed down if the creator ever stops changing it. These cookies are great to bring to parties or to enjoy by yourself. These are not your typical bake sale cookies, they are simple and complex</p>
        
        <h2><stong>Notes:</stong></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>In this recipe I like to use dark brown sugar but light will do fine</li>
            <li>Baking times will vary depending on bake ware and oven</li>
            <li>Allowing your dough to sit in the fridge will allow the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maillard_reaction">Maillard reaction</a> to occur, this improves flavor and texture </li>
            <li>My uncle has this technique of <em>spanking</em> the cookies. When they are almost done he takes the cookies out of the oven and presses a spatula into them flattening them out. Doing this and not doing this will produce great cookies but with different textures.</li>

        </ul>
